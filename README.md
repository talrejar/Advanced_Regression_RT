## General Information
A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price. For the same purpose, the company has collected a data set from the sale of houses in Australia. The data is provided in the CSV file below.


The company wants to know:

Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a house, and

How well those variables describe the price of a house.

Also, determine the optimal value of lambda for ridge and lasso regression.

Assignment Part-II - To answer the  list of 4 questions
<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
* Keep a check on the predictors that have direct impact on the price of the houses
* The higher +ve values of the coefficents indicates that the high sale value of the house
* The higher -ve values of the coefficents indicates that there is decrease in the sale of the house
* One should buy the house when there is actual price of the house is less than the predicted value of house price.
